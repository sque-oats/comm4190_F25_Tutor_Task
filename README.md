Testing LLMs as a Bike-Riding Tutor <br>

This repository explores how structured prompting can influence the behavior of a large language model (LLM) in simulating a tutoring session. The learning task for this project was riding a bike without training wheels. By comparing unstructured and structured tutoring sessions, this project examines how prompt design affects communication style, engagement, and instructional effectiveness. <br>
